# FreeTimeChat - Time Keeping Software

## Project Overview
A time tracking application with two distinct interfaces:
- **User Interface**: Chat-based interaction for all time tracking operations
- **Admin Interface**: Traditional web UI for management and reporting

## Architecture
- Next.js framework
- Chat interface as primary user interaction
- AI-powered natural language processing for time entry
- Admin dashboard with traditional CRUD operations

## Key Principles
1. Users should never need to navigate traditional UIs - everything through chat
2. Natural language understanding for time entries (e.g., "I worked 3 hours on project X")
3. Admin interface should be efficient and data-focused
4. Maintain clear separation between user chat and admin interfaces

## Available Commands
- `/feature` - Add new features to the project
- `/chat-handler` - Create or modify chat command handlers
- `/admin-ui` - Work on admin interface components
- `/test-chat` - Test chat functionality and responses
